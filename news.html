      <h3>University of Rochester Tournament</h3>
      <p>In the first pool, Cornell faced Rochester Gold in our first match. The good guys were off to a sluggish start, but were lifted by Brad Tiller's outstanding jump serves to claim their first victory of the day. Next on the list was Monroe Community College. Still early in the morning, Cornell slid by with a 2-0 victory led by setter, Matt Herbrand, resulting in a number one seed for redrafting of pools.</p>
      <p>For the second pool, Syracuse became the Big Red's next opponent. All around great team play allowed Cornell to take game one. The middles, Matt Thomas and Anthony Point, caught fire in game two hitting 100% each, allowing Cornell to convincingly take game two 25-11. CU faced Canisius College next. Coach Will Pluer made some strategic line up changes, moving middles to the outside and outsides to the middle. This method proved to be effective as Cornell rolled through Canisius 2-0. At the conclusion of pool play, Cornell held the undisputed number one seed for playoffs giving them a first round bye in the 6 team playoff.</p>
      <p>In the semi-finals, Pennsylvania College challenged Cornell's unblemished record. With two players over 6'5'', Cornell's defense was not phased. Incredible defense from our liberos/defensive specialists, Reed DesRosiers and Matt Ormseth, proved to be too much for Penn College to handle. Excellent positioning and skill by both players was on full display for this match as Cornell continued their 2-0 win pattern.</p>
      <p>Once again, Cornell found themselves in the championship match, this time versus SUNY Brockport. Cornell was well prepared for this challenge. Jacob Sachs held the reigns as setter. Although he was the smallest guy on the court, he had the biggest heart, and that's what counts. His intensity lifted the entire team. Middle, Anthony Point contributed with thunderous blocks on Brockport's go-to player while other middle, Matt Thomas connected on quick after quick with Sachs for a handful of kills. Consistent play all day from Will Valley continued in the finals with timely kills, mostly from the right side with impressive angled swings. Joe Gottwald embraced and thrived in the role as serving specialist, acquiring much needed aces with his smooth jump serve. Only a freshmen, Brad Tiller continues to impress with his mature play, rarely getting blocked and placing the ball in strategic positions. Adam Epstein contributed with his offensive play from the outside as well as back row attacks. None of the offense could have functioned without the continued excellence from Reed DesRosiers and Matt Ormseth on the defensive end. Each of their digs discouraged the opponent and lifted Cornell. In the end, Cornell proved that hard work does pay off, winning the match 2-0, becoming tournament champions.</p>
      <p>Result: <br>
        Tournament Champions</p>

Senior Josef Gottwald consistently makes an impact at the service line, earning 3 aces during this match. After this win, Coach Will Pluer maintains his unblemished record.</p>
